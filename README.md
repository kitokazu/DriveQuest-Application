# Drive Quest App

This is a larger scale project that I am apart of that is still in development. It is being developed over the course of 2 semesters by the students in the Software Engineering courses SE300/310 and SE 320 at Chapman University under Dr. Boyd. The SRS document linked below has a detailed overview of the product with its parameters, requirements, and goals. Throughout these classes and my time spent working on this project, I have learned about all aspects of the Software Development Cycle, and had the priveledge to see our team's work come to life on a real product that will soon be delivered to a company.

APP DESCRIPTION:
The California DMV driving test is a source of anxiety and stress for driving students. Combat this by using the Drive Quest Instructor, supported by the research-backed Drive Quest Authorized Driving School! Evaluate your student’s driving in a format similar to the DMV’s testing sheet and then send them their results so that they can practice at home.
